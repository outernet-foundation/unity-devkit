# unity-devkit

Unity build, license, and CI tooling. Projects are declared in a root `unity-devkit.json` catalog: each entry maps a stable project name to its path plus optional build intent (`builds`, `execute_methods`, `package`, `grant_permissions`, `tag_prefix`). Every command resolves projects through the catalog — absence from the catalog is the exclusion mechanism — and `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` inside each project remains the editor-version truth. Paired with the reusable [`unity-build.yml`](https://github.com/outernet-foundation/unity-devkit/blob/main/.github/workflows/unity-build.yml) GitHub Actions workflow hosted here — consumers call it cross-repo pinned to a pushed SHA with `secrets: inherit`.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.13+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
```

## Commands

Run from a repo root with a `unity-devkit.json` catalog declaring its Unity projects.

| `uv run <name>` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `compile-unity --project <name> --build <target>` | Local Unity build (APK or platform binary) suitable for `adb install`; `--stamp-version` stamps the version into `ProjectSettings.asset`; `--development`, `--environment <preset>`, and repeatable `--environment-field path=value` carry environment intent to the playerbuild entry. |
| `check-unity --project <name>` | Compile gate — batchmode open+quit that fails on compile errors; for repos that own editor code but build no players. |
| `install --project <name>` | Download the latest CI artifact and `adb install` (or launch, for `linux64`); with `--build`, compile locally first. |
| `lock-unity` | Lock Unity package versions. |
| `test-unity --project <name>` | Run editmode / playmode tests. |
| `activate-unity-license` | Activate the Unity Editor license (locally or with `--oras-push`). |
| `unity-license-tag` | Print the license cache tag. |
| `unity-matrix` | Emit the CI build matrix (CI-only; two `key=value` lines for `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`). |
| `unity-dispatch --project <name> --output <file>` | Generate the consumer's `workflow_dispatch` build workflow from the live environment class (preset choice, development toggle, one input per simple-typed field); `--check` is the drift gate for consumer CI. |
| `build-unity` | CI build with library-cache restore/save and version stamping (CI-only). |

Every command accepts `--help`.

## Consuming from another repo

Install from PyPI:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = ["unity-devkit>=0.1.0"]
```

Then `uv run compile-unity`, `uv run install`, etc. work from that repo against its own Unity projects — declare them in a root `unity-devkit.json` catalog (entries need `builds` + `execute_methods` where build intent is needed). To test an unreleased change, pin the repo at a git ref in a scratch branch instead (`unity-devkit = { git = "…", rev = "<sha>" }` under `[tool.uv.sources]`) and drop the pin when the release lands.

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run basedpyright
uv run pytest
```

The C# half (`packages/unity/PlayerBuild/Assets/Package/`, the `org.outernet.playerbuild` UPM package) compiles through `uv run check-unity --project PlayerBuild` and formats with CSharpier (`csharpier format packages/unity/PlayerBuild/Assets/Package`).
